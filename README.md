This repository contains the code for the Volumetric Multi-Parameter Persistence (VM-PP) approach for peak detection in noisy signals detailed in the paper 'A Multi-Parameter Persistence Algorithm for the Automatic Energy
Calibration of Scintillating Radiation Sensors' by G. Ferranti et al., available as a preprint at https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202506.0487/v1.


An interactive demo of VM-PP is available at https://volumetric-mpp.streamlit.app/ allowing to test the method on synthetic or user provided signals.
